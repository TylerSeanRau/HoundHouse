# HoundHouse Daemon Setup
This file explains how to use the files in this directory to get the HoundHouse service running as a systemd service.

## Daemon Install

1. Be sure a copy of the `HoundHouse` executable is in `/usr/bin/`

2. Move `spi.rules` into its desired location

        mv spi.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/.

3. Move `houndhouse.service` into its desired location

        mv houndhouse.service /etc/systemd/user/.

4. Enable the service

        systemctl enable /etc/systemd/user/houndhouse.service


## Cleaning up some issues that cause slow boot times

There are a couple of issues that cause unnessary slow boot times on a raspberry pi running ubuntu, here's how to fix those.

* The systemd-networkd-wait-online.service is ment to wait until the device is connected to the network succesffuly, however by default it waits for a specific interface to connect. Given this after 2 minutes of waiting for the specified device to connect to the network this service times out and failes.

    * My fix for this is to add the `--any` flag to the `ExecStart` line in `/lib/systemd/system/systemd-networkd-wait-online.service`

        * This allows systemd-networkd-wait-online.service to complete once **any** device is connected

* For some reason, by default in ubuntu, the ib\_user module is attempted to be loaded by /lib/modules-load.d/open-iscsi.conf during systemd-modules-load.service; however the packages needed for ib\_user are not included by default. _w.t.f._

    * To fix this, open `/lib/modules-load.d/open-iscsi.conf` and comment out the line for `ib_user` with a `#` at the beginning of the line.
